# DTN-Wallpaper

## Description

This is a tool that runs silently in the background and changes your wallpaper based on the time of day.

## Usage

Copy your wallpapers that should be rotated into the 'Rotation' folder. The first wallpaper has to be called '1.png', the second one '2.png' and so on. So if you want to have one wallpaper for each hour of the day you need 24 images, or 144 images if you want your wallpaper to switch every 10 minutes.  
Each file has to be a .png and make sure there are no other files in the folder.  
Just start 'DTN-Wallpaper.exe' and your wallpaper will begin to switch automatically. To stop the program use Task Manager.
